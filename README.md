# Asset-Creator
Have you ever had a 1024x1024 app icon, but find it painful to make a copy, resize/rename it every time you needed another size? Well, this small application intends to automate that whole process.

## Instructions
You will only need one thing: a large image (1024x1024 or bigger) app icon. Then, you just browse to the file inside of Asset Creator, and click the export button. The rest is done for you!

## Downloading
You can either download the source code and compile it yourself, or find a pre-compiled copy in the Releases tab. I will try to archive new commits as much as I can.
